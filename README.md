In this tutorial, we setup a VPN using Proton VPN and observe the changes of IP addresses from a personal PC to inside the VM. 
<h2>Video Demonstration</h2> 

- ### [VPN (Virtual Private Network) Explained](https://youtu.be/R-JUOpCgTZc)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Proton VPN

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (22H2)

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Observe IP address for physical PC
- Observe IP address within VM (VPN **NOT** connected)
- Observe IP address within VM (VPN connected)

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

_⚠️Before we start, if you haven't already, go ahead and create a **Microsoft Azure** and **Proton VPN** account on your physical PC._


1️⃣
First, we're going to create a VM in Azure running Windows 10, then, in a new tab find our IP address (as it relates to Country/Region) using https://whatismyipaddress.com/ .
Locate **Remote Desktop** on your PC. We will use this to remote into our VM that we created earlier, by using the **Public IP** address. Do so now.


_Now the fun begins! Its great that you made it into the VM._


2️⃣
Now that we're inside the VM, open up a browser, go to https://protonvpn.com/ and login . Once logged in we are going to download the VPN Client for our operating system in use and begin installing it.
